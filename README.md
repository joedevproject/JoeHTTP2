This project began way back when. Back then, I had no idea how the internet got to your computer and the way that the browsers communicate with the servers. In this project, it is a step up from my first project, JoeHTTP.

In this project I hope to add some new tags to HTML pages. I am slowly making my way there.
EXTRA NOTE: This is an API for developers.
